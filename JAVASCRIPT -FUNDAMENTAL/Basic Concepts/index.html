    <h1>Welcome to JavaScript</h1>
    <h2>What is JavaScript and how does work ?</h2>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: large; font-style: normal; color: brown; width: 65%;">JavaScript is a versatile, high-level
        programming
        language commonly used to make websites interactive and
        dynamic. It's an essential part of web development, alongside HTML (which structures web pages) and CSS (which
        styles them).</p>


    <p style="width: 45%; font-size: large;  ">How does JavaScript works:
        <br>
        <br>
        1.Client-Side Execution: JavaScript usually runs in your browser, directly on your device. When you open a
        webpage, your browser reads the HTML and CSS and executes JavaScript to enable features like animations, form
        validations, or interactive menus.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. DOM Manipulation: It interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure of a
        webpage. JavaScript can modify the DOM dynamicallyâ€”changing the content, adding elements, or altering styles
        based on user actions.
        <br>
        <br>
        3 .Event Handling: JavaScript responds to events, like clicks, scrolls, or keypresses. For example, when you
        click
        a button to submit a form, JavaScript can validate the form data before sending it to a server.
        <br>
        <br>
        4. Server-Side Execution: With environments like Node.js, JavaScript can also be used to build server-side
        applications, handle databases, or manage backend tasks.

        }

        // const output = document.getElementById("output")
        // output.addEventListener("click,", function () {
        //     alert(" this is sample button ")
        // });
